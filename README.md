# Brain Tumor Image Classification and Streamlit App

## Overview
This repository contains the code for an image classification project focused on identifying brain tumors. The project involves solving an image classification problem, and an end-to-end Streamlit application has been built for interactive tumor classification.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle. Due to the size limitations of GitHub, the dataset itself is not included in this repository. You can find and download the dataset on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset

## Kaggle Notebook
The initial development and experimentation for this project were done in a Kaggle notebook. The notebook showcasing the problem-solving process can be found on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/code/hakim11/brain-mri-classification

## Hyperparameter Tuning
The model in this project has undergone hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner to optimize its performance. The best hyperparameters determined during tuning are incorporated into the final model.

## Streamlit App
An end-to-end Streamlit application has been developed to provide a user-friendly interface for classifying brain tumors. The app allows users to upload an image and receive predictions from the trained model.

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the image classification model and the Streamlit app.
- `data/`: Placeholder for the dataset. Users need to download the dataset from Kaggle.
- `notebooks/`: Placeholder for any additional Jupyter notebooks used for exploration or analysis.
- `streamlit_app/`: Contains the files for the Streamlit app.
- `README.txt`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## How to Use
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the code in the `src/` directory to train and evaluate the image classification model.
3. Navigate to the `streamlit_app/` directory and run the Streamlit app to interactively classify brain tumors.
